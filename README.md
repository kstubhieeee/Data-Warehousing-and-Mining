# Data Warehousing and Mining Experiments

This repository contains data warehousing and mining experiments performed in Python. The list of experiments is as follows:

- **Experiment 3:** Detailed study of a Business Intelligence tool (e.g., XLMiner) and implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier.
- **Experiment 4:** Implementation of the Decision Tree classifier.
- **Experiment 5:** Implementation of the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm.
- **Experiment 6:** Implementation of Clustering algorithms (K-means/K-medoids).
- **Experiment 7:** Implementation of the FP-Tree Algorithm.
- **Experiment 10:** Implementation of the Page Rank / HITS algorithm.
